<h2>About Me</h2>
<p> I was born May 27, 2001 in Portland, Oregon; I lived there for 10 years, then moved to Penang, Malaysia for 1.5 years for my dad's work. Initially, we were supposed to stay there for 2 years but moved 6 months early due to feelings of extreme nostalgia by my sister and I; therefore, we decided to move to Austin.</p>
<p> I have been living in Austin for around 4.5 years and attend James Bowie High School where I'm going to be a rising junior.
